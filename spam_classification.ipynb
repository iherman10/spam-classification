    "# Frame the problem and look at the big picture\n",
    "This is exercise #4 from Chapter 3 of Hands-On Machine Learning, which covers classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Define the objective__: the task is to build a spam classifier using data from [Apache SpamAssassin's public datasets](https://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/) ([README](https://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/readme.html)). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. __How will your solution be used?__ this could be used by an email service like Gmail to automatically flag and filter out messages that have a high probability of being spam. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. __What are the current solutions/workarounds (if any)?__ Well, spam filters do already exist in most if not all email services. That being said, some spam emails still get through, so it's up to users to identify those on their own. In addition, when a spam email does get through, users can mark it as spam, and all future emails from that address will be automatically marked as spam. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. __How should you frame this problem (supervised/unsupervised, online/offline, etc.)?__ This is a __supervised classification task__ because we are making binary predictions (spam vs. ham) and we have labeled training data. Ideally, this is an online learning task, because spammers never stop thinking of new ways to trick people, so the model should be learning from new data constantly. However, for the sake of this exercise, it will be an offline system using static training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. __How should performance be measured?__ This is a bit more complex than the Titanic task, for example, where _accuracy_ was our primary performance metric. Is it better to lean further towards spam and risk misclassifying safe emails as spam? Or is it better to lean further towards \"ham\" and risk missing spam emails?\n",
    "    - According to ChatGPT: \"For a spam classifier, it is generally more fitting to __prioritize precision over recall__.\" This is because a spam classifier that marks safe emails as spam is a real nuisance to users, whereas missing a few spam emails is not as big a deal. By focusing on precision, we will minimize false positives and reduce the chances of misclassifying safe emails. \n",
    "    - `Precision = TP / (TP + FP)`\n",
    "    - It seems that a __precision of 95%__ is the widely recommended benchmark for spam classifiers. Maybe let's be lenient with our solution and target __90% precision__. \n",
    "    \n",
    "6. __Is the performance measure aligned with the business objective?__\n",
    "\n",
    "7. __What would be the minimum performance needed to reach the business objective?__\n",
    "\n",
    "8. __What are comparable problems? Can you reuse experience or tools?__\n",
    "\n",
    "9. __Is human expertise available?__\n",
    "\n",
    "10. __How would you solve the problem manually?__\n",
    "\n",
    "11. __List assumptions you've made so far.__\n",
    "\n",
    "12. __Verify assumptions if possible__"
