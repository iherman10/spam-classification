# Overview 
The goal of this project was to build a spam-classification model for email clients. This was an end-of-chapter exercise from Chapter 3 of the book Hands-On Machine Learning (Aurelien), which covered classification tasks. 

Beyond the spam application specifically, this project was an opportunity to implement an end-to-end ML project while utilizing various methods to build and compare different classification models (performance metrics, hyperparameter tuning, ROC AUC curves, etc.).
